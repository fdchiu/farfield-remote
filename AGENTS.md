# AGENTS.md

This repo is a local Codex monitor workspace.

## Basic Workflow

1. Read the request and inspect the current code before changing anything.
2. Make the smallest clean change that solves the issue.
3. Run focused checks for the files you changed.
4. Keep commits small and scoped to one logical change.
5. Before committing, review the staged diff carefully.

## Commands You Will Use Often

- `pnpm dev`
- `pnpm typecheck`
- `pnpm test`
- `pnpm lint`

## Trace Privacy Rules (Strict)

Never commit raw traces from `traces/`.

If you need traces for tests:

1. Put raw trace files in `traces/` only.
2. Run `pnpm sanitize:traces`.
3. Use only sanitized files from:
   - `packages/codex-protocol/test/fixtures/sanitized/`
4. Manually inspect sanitized files before any commit.
5. Run a sensitive-data scan before staging or committing:
   - `rg -n "/Users/|\\\\Users\\\\|github\\.com|git@|https?://|token|api[_-]?key|PRIVATE KEY|rollout-" packages/codex-protocol/test/fixtures/sanitized`
6. Review what is staged:
   - `git diff --staged -- packages/codex-protocol/test/fixtures/sanitized`

If there is any personal data, secrets, URLs, paths, or conversation text that should not be public, do not commit. Fix sanitization first.

## Commit Rule for Trace-Based Tests

If a unit test uses trace-derived fixtures, the commit must include:

- Sanitized fixture files only.
- A quick note in the commit message that traces were sanitized and manually checked.
